# Typing-Test
This is a typing test app made with python using the pygame library. This will display words per minute and accuracy.

## Instructions
Python 3 needs to be downloaded.
Run the main.py file.

## Adding Other Text Files
In the texts folder you can add any text file as long as it ends with the .txt extension. There are also some errors with quotation marks
and semicolons that are copied from webpages so replacing them by re-typing them works.
